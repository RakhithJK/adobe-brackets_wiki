#brackets-app Command line argument processing

## Overview
Currently, all interaction within the Brackets application must be performed interactively by the user.  This includes the act of opening files and folder trees for editing.  While this might be acceptable for most cases, it is desirable for the brackets shell application to be configurable at launch time via arguments specified at launch.

## Scope
### Arguments on Launch

### Communicating with a running Application

### File Association

### Interaction with Extensions

## Implementation Notes

### Boost program.options?
