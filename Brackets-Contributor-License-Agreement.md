If you want to contribute to Brackets, make sure you have read and signed the Brackets Contributor License Agreement (CLA). We're not a big fan of legal documents, but this one is important. We choose to release and develop Brackets under an MIT License so there are no limitations to where the code can go and what you can do with it. To protect that freedom, we need to make sure the code you contribute is your own.
