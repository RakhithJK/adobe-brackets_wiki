Is there something you'd like to see in Brackets?

We keep our backlog of feature ideas on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/LCDud1Nd/brackets). You can **vote for the features you'd most like to see** by clicking on a card and clicking the "vote" button.

## How to find a feature on Trello

There's a good chance that the feature you're interested in has already been suggested and you just need to upvote it. We have a lot of cards on our Trello board, which can make finding the one you want a little challenging.

Trello has a search box at the top, which may find what you're looking for. I often use the slightly hidden "Filter" feature:

Here's how you do it:

**Show the Sidebar**

**Open the Menu**

**Click on the Filter option**

**Enter your search or select labels**

For example, if you type `SASS` into the filter box, Trello will show all of the cards related to adding [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) features.
