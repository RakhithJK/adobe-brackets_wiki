# Extension Management Research #

In Sprint 21, we had a story to research [Extension Management Workflow and Metadata](https://trello.com/card/3-research-extension-management-workflow-metadata/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88/767). This document has a summary of the results and links to the details. If you're interested in diving straight into all of the details, take a look at the "Detailed Documents" section at the end.
