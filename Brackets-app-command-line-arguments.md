# Handling Command Line Arguments

## Overview
Generally, applications are able to process arguments specified by the user upon launch.  These arguments often can be used to configure the application, retrieve information from the application or instruct it to perform various operations upon initialization.

This spec describes an initial set of arguments that Brackets supports, with a general focus on exposing existing features.  It also describes the general framework in which the command line arguments are handled.  As additional arguments are needed in the future, they should be added to this document.
