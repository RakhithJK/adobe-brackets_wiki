Brackets not working for you? Consider the following tips.

## Cache
If you had previous used Brackets, your cache may have information that is conflicting with the most recent version. [Find your cache folder](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Cache-Folder) and delete the cache.

## Command Line
Next, try running Brackets from the command line. Open up a Terminal (or Command Prompt in Windows), navigate to the executable, and run Brackets. Did an error appear?

## Developer Tools
If Brackets opens, but behaves incorrectly, don't forget you can open the Developer Tools. Under the Debug Menu, select "Show Developer Tools" to open an instance of the Developer Tools for Brackets. If you've used the Developer Tools in Chrome this will look familiar. Ensure the Console tab is open and see if any errors show up there.
