## Disable All Extensions
When troubleshooting, it's useful to know if the problem is caused by an extension you've installed. Use `Debug > Reload Without Extensions` to quickly check whether the same problem still happens with all your extensions disabled. To re-enable your extensions, just quit and relaunch Brackets, or choose Debug > Reload _With_ Extensions.

If that fixes the issue, you can narrow down which extension was the problem by following [the instructions here](http://help.brackets.io/knowledgebase/articles/335164-brackets-running-oddly-but-not-covered-in-other-a).
