We have quite a few Live Preview issues opened and it's not always easy to determine which ones are duplicates. To make matters more complicated, others jump into existing conversations and say "Me too, I'm seeing [whatever]" which is often a totally different problem.

This wiki page was started to help us manage the issues. When I say "us", I mean both the Brackets Team trying to prioritize and fix bugs, and anyone using Brackets trying to figure out if what they are seeing is a known or new issue (and where to find more info).

If you are trying to find out if something is a known issue, start by reading:
* [How to Use Brackets: Live Preview](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets#wiki-live-preview)
* [Troubleshooting: Live Preview](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Troubleshooting#wiki--live-preview-isnt-working)
