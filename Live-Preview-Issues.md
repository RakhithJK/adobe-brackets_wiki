We have quite a few Live Preview issues opened and it's not always easy find a known issue. This wiki page was started to help us manage the issues. When I say "us", I mean both the Brackets Team trying to prioritize and fix bugs, and anyone using Brackets trying to figure out if what they are seeing is a known or new issue (and where to find more info).

If you are trying to find out if something is a known issue, start by reading:
* [How to Use Brackets: Live Preview](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets#wiki-live-preview)
* [Troubleshooting: Live Preview](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Troubleshooting#wiki--live-preview-isnt-working)
