Brackets bugs are tracked in [the Brackets github issue tracker](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues). 
When filing a new bug, please remember to include:

* Brackets version/sprint number (or commit SHA if you're pulling directly from the repo (see below)).
* Platform/OS version
* Reproducible steps, actual and expected results
* Link to test files (you can create a gist on [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/) 
if that's convenient)

For feature requests, go ahead and file them in the issue tracker; they'll be converted
to user stories on the [public Brackets backlog](https://trello.com/board/brackets/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88).
