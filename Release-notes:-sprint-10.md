**Sprint 10 is still in progress.** These are **draft** notes.

UI Changes
----------
* "Debug > Enable JSLint" has moved to "View > Enable JSLint"
* "Debug > Use Tab Characters" has moved to "Edit > Use Tab Characters"

Menu API Changes
----------------
The following functions no longer take an ID parameter:

addMenuItem()
addMenuDivider()

Also, the relativeID parameter has changed. Previously this parameter specified the id of another MenuItem. Now it references the id of a Command that exists in the parent menu to specify a location. The net result is that MenuItems no longer have externally exposed IDâ€™s.

These changes simplify the API, but will break existing extensions that add menus, so please update your Brackets extensions with this change.

Document/Editor API Changes
---------------------------
Mutator APIs have been added to Document. Text-editing commands should use these Document APIs to modify the text, instead of going through Editor or CodeMirror. For more details on Document usage, see "Working with Documents" in the [[Brackets Development How Tos]].

* Added to Document: replaceRange(), getRange(), getLine(), batchOperation().
* Changed Document.getText() so it always returns \n line endings (like the above new APIs) unless a special flag is passed.
* Remove Editor.getLineText() -- superseded by Document.getLine()

Project API Changes
-------------------
The events dispatched by ProjectManager have changed. Instead of dispatching `initializeComplete` and `projectRootChanged`, we now dispatch `projectOpen` and `beforeProjectClose` events. `beforeProjectClose` is dispatched before the project root is about to change, and `projectOpen` is dispatched afterwards. Also, `projectOpen` is dispatched after the initial project is opened when Brackets first launches.

New Utility APIs
----------------
* Unit testing: waitsForDone() function for using Promise/Deferred ([see forum post](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/brackets-dev/Y2RrDLv5DPI))
* Unit testing: SpecRunnerUtils.deleteFile()
