**Sprint 10 is still in progress.** These are **draft** notes.    
What's new in Sprint 10
----------------------
We didn't add major new user-visible features in Sprint 9. Our main goals for the sprint were similar to the previous sprint - Continue to make progress on the extensibility architecture of Brackets: *research, basic architecture and extensibility API*:
* **Architecture / Contributions**
     * CodeMirror contributions (NJ)     
This [Story](https://trello.com/c/XxKi7w8x) is about submitting scrolling enhancements to CodeMirror, there were a number of pull requests related to fix flickering during vertical scrolling in CodeMirror, further details can be found here:
         * [#534](https://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror2/pull/534)
         * [#551](https://github.com/marijnh/CodeMirror2/pull/551)
     
     * Build experimental CEF3 Shell (Glenn, Raymond)    
The [Story](https://trello.com/c/8Vuom2dA) indicates work in progress, for example there hasn't been a lot of scenario testing yet. The changes are manifesting in the performance improvements and better responsiveness running in the multi-process modes.     

* **Extensibility Epic**     
      * The [JavaScript Quick Edit] (https://trello.com/c/8d7sdB54) story (NJ, Jason, Randy, Peter, Joel) allows you to quickly access and edit JavaScript function bodies from the calling function within HTML and JavaScript files.Some nice work went into performance instrumentation and building [Unit Tests](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Extension-Experiments#wiki-unittests).    
      * The second extensibility [Story - Extension support for require.js text plugin](https://trello.com/c/BKQnEDRa) (Jason) in Sprint 10 enables extension developer to use the [require.js text plugin] (https://github.com/requirejs/text) without having to include it for each extension.    
      * We now support [HTML Context Menus](https://trello.com/c/Um2Nlhh9) (Ty, Randy, Peter) in Brackets - please also refer to the Menu API changes mentioned below.
      * We started working on [basic guidelines](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Extension-UI-Guidelines) for Extensions UI ([User Story])(https://trello.com/c/tDdqua2R) (Garth)
      * Last not least [Extension Stylesheets](https://trello.com/c/ltSP2dcY) (Jason) you can now specify css stylesheets to style and define the UI for any extension.


Major external contributions
----------------------------
* no mayor additions this sprint

UI Changes
----------
* "Debug > Enable JSLint" has moved to "View > Enable JSLint"
* "Debug > Use Tab Characters" has moved to "Edit > Use Tab Characters"

Menu API Changes
----------------
The following functions no longer take an ID parameter:

addMenuItem()
addMenuDivider()

Also, the relativeID parameter has changed. Previously this parameter specified the id of another MenuItem. Now it references the id of a Command that exists in the parent menu to specify a location. The net result is that MenuItems no longer have externally exposed IDâ€™s.

These changes simplify the API, but will break existing extensions that add menus, so please update your Brackets extensions with this change.

Document/Editor API Changes
---------------------------
Mutator APIs have been added to Document. Text-editing commands should use these Document APIs to modify the text, instead of going through Editor or CodeMirror. For more details on Document usage, see "Working with Documents" in the [[Brackets Development How Tos]].

* Added to Document: replaceRange(), getRange(), getLine(), batchOperation().
* Changed Document.getText() so it always returns \n line endings (like the above new APIs) unless a special flag is passed.
* Remove Editor.getLineText() -- superseded by Document.getLine()

Project API Changes
-------------------
The events dispatched by ProjectManager have changed. Instead of dispatching `initializeComplete` and `projectRootChanged`, we now dispatch `projectOpen` and `beforeProjectClose` events. `beforeProjectClose` is dispatched before the project root is about to change, and `projectOpen` is dispatched afterwards. Also, `projectOpen` is dispatched after the initial project is opened when Brackets first launches.

New Utility APIs
----------------
* Unit testing: waitsForDone() function for using Promise/Deferred ([see forum post](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/brackets-dev/Y2RrDLv5DPI))
* Unit testing: SpecRunnerUtils.deleteFile()


Bugs fixed in Sprint 10
