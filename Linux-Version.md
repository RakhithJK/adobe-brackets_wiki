Feature Status
====

The latest Linux builds (as of Sprint 27), are *near* feature parity with the the Mac and Windows builds. However, there are notable features (e.g. Node.js integration and extension install UI) that are in various stages of planning and development. To be clear though, Brackets features going forward that only rely on features in the browser can be developed in lock-step on all 3 platforms.
