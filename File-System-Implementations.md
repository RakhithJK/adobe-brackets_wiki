The front-end client-facing filesystem API is decoupled from the back-end filesystem implementation in order to accommodate completely different kinds of filesystems. For example, the clients can consistently access filesystems for accessing local files based on Brackets shell or Node.JS, or for accessing remove files stored on Dropbox or SkyDrive. This page describes the requirements for implementing a filesystem back-end implementation.
