# Extension Dependencies Research #

(This may eventually become documentations on how extension dependencies are handled.)

The experience that Node users have with npm provides some useful background:

* [npm now supports "peer dependencies" for packages that are needed but not required in](http://blog.nodejs.org/2013/02/07/undefined/)
* There was a useful discussion about how [npm avoids dependency hell](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/nodejs/0iQDxCIznO0) in October 2011
