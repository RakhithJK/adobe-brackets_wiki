What's new in Sprint 9
----------------------
We didn't add major new user-visible features in Sprint 9. Our main goals for the sprint were similar to the previous sprint - research, basic architecture and extensibility API:
* Architecture / Research

    * Continue to make progress on the extensibility architecture of Brackets
        * CEF3 vs. Chromium Content Shell research  (Glenn) 
        * Node vs V8 for bridging into native  (Glenn, Joel, Raymond)
            * A prototype implementation is checked into the *node-proxy* branches in adobe/brackets and adobe/brackets-app repos.
