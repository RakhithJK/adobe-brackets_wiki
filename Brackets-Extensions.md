## Installing Extensions ##

To install most of the extensions below, just right click its link, copy the URL and then paste into the *File > Install Extension...* dialog. Extensions will start up right away after they're installed.

(Some extensions might not work by just copying and pasting the GitHub repo URL if they have submodules. Authors who post such extensions are encouraged to link directly to a ZIP file with all the submodules included.)

#### Updating and Removing Extensions

Removing an extension or updating it to a new version is still a little more manual. Select _Help > Show Extensions Folder_ and delete the extension folder in question. Restart Brackets to fully remove the extension. Then you can install a newer copy using the steps above.

## Extensions List ##

Here's a list of extensions that people have built.

If you've written an extension &ndash; even just as an experiment &ndash; please feel free to edit this page directly and add it (with some indication of what state it's in), and post to the [brackets-dev Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/brackets-dev) to let the community know about it.
