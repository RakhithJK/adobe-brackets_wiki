Brackets doesn't yet have functionality for discovering and installing extensions. In the meantime, here's a list of extensions that people have built. You can copy them into the `brackets/src/extensions/user` folder, then reload or restart Brackets.

If you've written an extension (even just as an experiment), please feel free to edit this page directly and add it (with some indication of what state it's in). Thanks!

* [Snippets](https://github.com/jrowny/brackets-snippets)
* [MDNLookup](https://github.com/pamelafox/brackets-MDNLookup-extension): Includes a way of creating an extensions toolbar and adding buttons to the toolbar with callbacks. Requires a slight change to the core.
* [String Convert](https://github.com/mikechambers/StringConvert): Provides shortcuts for modifying and encoding strings within the editor.
* [Recent projects](https://github.com/njx/brackets-recent-projects): Makes it so you can click on the project name in the sidebar to get a dropdown that shows a list of recent project folders.
* [ToGist](https://github.com/davidderaedt/togist): Create a gist from current selection.
* [Prefixr](https://github.com/davidderaedt/prefixr-extension): Generate browser specific CSS prefixes using the prefixr service.
