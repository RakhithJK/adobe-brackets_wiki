Brackets doesn't yet have functionality for discovering and installing extensions. In the meantime, here's a list of extensions that people have built. You can copy them into the `brackets/src/extensions/user` folder, then reload or restart Brackets.

If you've written an extension (even just as an experiment), please feel free to edit this page directly and add it (with some indication of what state it's in). Thanks!

* [Snippets](https://github.com/jrowny/brackets-snippets): Assign trigger keys to insert snippets. Configurable with JSON
* [MDNLookup](https://github.com/pamelafox/brackets-MDNLookup-extension): Includes a way of creating an extensions toolbar and adding buttons to the toolbar with callbacks. Requires a slight change to the core.
* [String Convert](https://github.com/mikechambers/StringConvert): Provides shortcuts for modifying and encoding strings within the editor.
* [Recent projects](https://github.com/njx/brackets-recent-projects): Makes it so you can click on the project name in the sidebar to get a dropdown that shows a list of recent project folders.
* [ToGist](https://github.com/davidderaedt/togist): Create a gist from current selection.
* [Prefixr](https://github.com/davidderaedt/prefixr-extension): Generate browser specific CSS prefixes using the prefixr service.
* [App Cache Buddy](https://github.com/davidderaedt/appcache-gen): Generate and validate application cache manifests.
* [Reload in Browser](https://github.com/DennisKehrig/brackets.ReloadInBrowser): Adds a toolbar button and shortcut to reload the page in the browser
* [Extension Manager](https://github.com/jdiehl/brackets-extension-manager): Prototype for an extension manager. Static database for now (featuring the extensions on this page) and you need to start a seperate node server to make it work.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/jrowny/brackets-github): Implements the GitHub API, including oAuth. Currently functionality limited to Gists.
