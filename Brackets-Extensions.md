Brackets doesn't yet have functionality for discovering and installing extensions. In the meantime, here's a list of extensions that people have built. You can copy them into the `brackets/src/extensions/user` folder, then reload or restart Brackets.

If you've written an extension (even just as an experiment), please feel free to edit this page directly and add it (with some indication of what state it's in). Thanks!

**Code/text editing**
* [Snippets](https://github.com/jrowny/brackets-snippets): Assign trigger keys to insert snippets. Configurable with JSON
* [String Convert](https://github.com/mikechambers/StringConvert): Provides shortcuts for modifying and encoding strings within the editor.
* [Prefixr](https://github.com/davidderaedt/prefixr-extension): Generate browser specific CSS prefixes using the prefixr service.
