Brackets doesn't yet have functionality for discovering and installing extensions. In the meantime, here's a list of extensions that people have built. You can copy them into the `brackets/src/extensions/user` folder, then reload or restart Brackets.

* [Snippets](https://github.com/jrowny/brackets-snippets)
* [MDNLookup](https://github.com/pamelafox/brackets-MDNLookup-extension): Includes a way of creating an extensions toolbar and adding buttons to the toolbar with callbacks. Requires a slight change to the core.
* [String Convert](https://github.com/mikechambers/StringConvert): Provides shortcuts for modifying and encoding strings within the editor.
* [Recent projects](https://github.com/njx/brackets-recent-projects): Makes it so you can click on the project name in the sidebar to get a dropdown that shows a list of recent project folders.
