In Brackets, icons are used to:

* leverage globally understood visual concepts, or where icons usage is more conventional than text
* save space by using an easily understood symbol, where localization or text orientation is constrained
direct the user visually and break down or differentiate elements (i.e. feature lists)
* enforce consistency within the application
* make the interface visually engaging.

# Styleguide

* use simple shapes that are not too detailed, use as less anchor points as possible
* make sure it's flat i.e. without gradients, highlights, or shadows
* the corners are slightly rounded
* use thinner lines rather than thicker lines
* try to use SVG instead of PNG

## Icon Size:   

* 20px by 20px
* for sprites use a grid with gridlines 20px apart.

## Use Colors to Show Extension State:

The icon should be white with opacity set to 0.7 in the CSS by default.

* pressed state has an opacity of 0.5 set in CSS on the white icon
* disabled state has an opacity of 0.3 set in CSS on the white icon
