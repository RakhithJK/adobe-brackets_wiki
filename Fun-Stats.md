# Collecting Fun Stats

## Sprint Stats

* [Sprint download stats](http://download.brackets.io/report.cfm)
* [Issues fixed in sprint](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues?direction=desc&milestone=13&page=1&sort=created&state=closed) - Need to update milestone for current sprint
* Pull Requests Closed: [brackets](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pulls?direction=desc&page=1&sort=created&state=closed), [brackets-shell](https://github.com/adobe/brackets-shell/pulls?direction=desc&page=1&sort=created&state=closed)
    - Need to manually count back to when sprint started.
    - Note that not all "Closed" pull requests were "Merged".
    - Count external committers separately.
* [Extensions](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions) - Manually subtract total from previous sprint. [History page](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Extensions/_history) could be used to collect count from previous sprint.
