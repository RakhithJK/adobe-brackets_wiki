What's New in Sprint 31
-----------------------
* **Live Preview**
    * [Live Preview HTML changes](https://trello.com/c/ya9wexlA/998-2-improve-html-live-development-performance): Live Preview updates in real time as you type in HTML files. Updates pause whenever the HTML is not syntactically valid.
* **Overall UI**
    * [Compact, dark titlebar  on Windows](https://trello.com/card/5-into-darkness-shell-windows/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88/874): A similar change will be [coming soon for Mac](https://trello.com/card/into-darkness-shell-osx/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88/900) too.
    * [Keyboard shortcut to switch between recent projects](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/4546): Press Ctrl+Alt+R (&#x2325;âŒ˜R) to open the "recent projects" dropdown, then use the arrows and Enter to switch projects.
* **CSS Code Hints in SCSS**
    * [Code hints for CSS property names & values](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/4931): The same code hints you see in CSS files will now also appear in SCSS files.
    * [Quick Docs for CSS properties](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/5069): Ditto &ndash; just like in CSS.
* **HTML Matching Tag Highlighting**
    * [Highlight matching open/close tag](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/4504)
* **Search**
    * [Update Find in Files results while typing](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/4729)
* **Linting**
    * [Extensibility for linting tools](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/4588)

UI Changes
----------
TODO: Windows shell appearance

TODO: [UI indicating](https://trello.com/c/cmkAdt20/985-2-live-development-html-ui-for-invalid-state) HTML is invalid & won't be syncing

TODO: Implement document proxy icon in Brackets editor


API Changes
-----------
TODO: KeyBindingManager clearer semantics for `platform`

TODO: CodeHintManager Response.query


New/Improved Extensibility APIs
-------------------------------
* **Linting** - Use `CodeInspection.register()` to provide linting/inspection for a given Language. Just like the built-in JSLint functionality, the provider is invoked whenever a file is opened or saved, and its results are displayed in a panel below the editor (providers may be run more frequently in the future, however). Currently, only one provider is accepted per language, although extensions _can_ replace the default JSLint provider for JavaScript.

* **Code Hints** - The behavior of the CodeHintList on tab key events is now configurable on a global and per-CodeHintProvider basis. The CodeHintManager provider registration API has been generalized with an additional optional property, `insertHintOnTab`, that indicates whether the CodeHintManager should request that the provider of the current session insert the currently selected hint on tab key events, or if instead a tab character should be inserted into the editor. See [#5084](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/5084 "Make code hint insertion on tab key configurable") for more details.


Known Issues
------------
* Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) by default will not allow Brackets to run since it's not digitally signed yet. To work around this, right click the Brackets app and choose Open. You only need to do that once -- afterward, launching Brackets the normal way will work also.
* [#2272](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/2272): Windows Vista may not allow the Brackets installer to run (you may not see _any_ error message). To work around this, right-click the installer file, choose Properties, and click the Unblock button.
* [#4362](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/4362): Slow startup of Brackets and Live Preview on Windows due to Chrome proxy settings. See workaround https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/106010?hl=en.
* _Debug > Run Tests_ is disabled in the installer/DMG distributions of Brackets, because the unit test code is not included. To run unit tests, [pull Brackets from GitHub](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets#wiki-getcode) instead.
