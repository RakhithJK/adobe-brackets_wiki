## General Questions

* **What would be the difference between embedding Brackets and embedding CodeMirror?**
    * CodeMirror: just editing,
    * Brackets: file management, server APIs (github), extensions+inline
* **How does the editor work?**
    * CodeMirror, pushing changes back into CodeMirror.
* **Are there apps for iPad/Android?**
    * Not now, will wrap in PhoneGap in the future
* **Is it at all possible to run it on web right now, or has noone written that?**
    * They tried it once a while ago. Tricky because dependent on Chromium version, might not work with other browsers or look good. Also file API.
* **Is there a video that shows the cool demoâ€™d features (inline CSS/HTML/JS)?** 
    * Not yet.
* **Are there any plans to use right-click/context menu?**
    * Eventually.
